# NPTEL-Hardware-Modeling-Using-Verilog
This repository contains all the materials, assignments, and Verilog codes that I practiced and completed as part of the NPTEL course ‚ÄúHardware Modeling using Verilog‚Äù, taught by Prof. Indranil Sengupta, IIT Kharagpur.

The course helped me gain a solid understanding of RTL design, simulation, and hardware description using Verilog HDL.


# Topics Covered

Verilog HDL fundamentals

Dataflow, behavioral, and structural modeling

Combinational and sequential circuits

FSM (Finite State Machine) design

Testbench writing and simulation

Hierarchical design and module instantiation

Timing control and blocking vs non-blocking assignments

Hardware synthesis and optimization concepts

In the end of this course we have Successfully completed implimentation of  "MIPS32(RISK) processor"

# Tools Used

Xilinx Vivado (for synthesis)

ModelSim / EDA Playground

GTKWAVE (for waveform analysis)

# üèÜ Certification

Successfully completed the NPTEL course and obtained a certificate from IIT Kharagpur.

# Future Plans

Implementing small RTL design projects

Creating optimized testbenches

Exploring synthesis and FPGA implementation
