//***********SEQUENCE DETECTING***********
//_____FSM mealy method
//___Design Of a sequence detector.
//A circuit accepts a serial bit stream "x" as input and produces a serial bit stream " zrâ€¢ as output.
//Whenever the bit pattern "0110" appears in the input stream, it outputs z = 1; at all other times, z = O.
//Overlapping occurrences of the pattern are also detected.
//This is a Mealy Machine.
